       " 'extra_info': {'answer': '<think> Okay, so I need to solve this problem about a linear function f(x) = ax + b defined on the interval [-10, 10]. The condition given is that the sum of the absolute values of f(x) at 100 evenly spaced points in that interval is equal to 1000. We have to find M - m, where M is the maximum possible value of |f(0)| and m is the minimum possible value. Hmm, let\\'s break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the setup. The function is linear, so its graph is a straight line. The interval is from -10 to 10, and we\\'re evaluating the absolute value of the function at 100 equally spaced points in this interval. The sum of these absolute values is 1000. Our goal is to find the maximum and minimum possible values of |f(0)| given this condition, and then compute their difference.\\n\\nAlright, let\\'s start by figuring out how the 100 points are spaced. The interval from -10 to 10 has a total length of 20. If we have 100 points, that means the distance between each consecutive point is 20/(100 - 1). Wait, hold on, actually, when you have evenly spaced points between two endpoints, the number of intervals is one less than the number of points. So the spacing between points would be (10 - (-10))/(100 - 1) = 20/99 ≈ 0.2020... Hmm, that\\'s a bit messy, but maybe I can work with that. Alternatively, maybe we can model the points as x_k = -10 + k*(20/99), where k ranges from 0 to 99. Yeah, that seems right.\\n\\nSo, the sum S(a, b) = Σ_{k=0}^{99} |f(x_k)| = Σ_{k=0}^{99} |a*x_k + b| = 1000. We need to find the maximum and minimum values of |f(0)| = |b|, since f(0) = a*0 + b = b. Therefore, our target is to maximize and minimize |b| given that S(a, b) = 1000.\\n\\nSo, problem reduces to optimizing |b| with the constraint that the sum of the absolute values of the linear function at these points is 1000. \\n\\nHmm, absolute values complicate things because they are non-differentiable and make the function non-linear. But since the function is linear, maybe there\\'s symmetry or some pattern here. Since it\\'s a linear function, the absolute value will form a V-shape graph, so the sum of absolute deviations is a common concept in statistics, related to the median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations.\\n\\nBut here we are given that the sum is 1000 and want to maximize/minimize |b|. Since b is the y-intercept, which is f(0). So perhaps the strategy is to adjust a and b so that the line is as high or as low as possible while keeping the sum of deviations fixed?\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider that the sum of absolute values of ax + b over these points must equal 1000, and we need to find the extremal |b|.\\n\\nTo approach this, maybe it\\'s useful to think of b in terms of the function. Let me see.\\n\\nFirst, note that the points x_k are symmetric around 0 because the interval is from -10 to 10. The midpoint is 0. Let me confirm that: since the spacing is 20/99 between -10 and 10, the points will indeed be symmetric around 0. Since 100 is even? Wait, 100 is even, so there\\'s no exact midpoint, but the points are symmetric in pairs. For each k from 0 to 49, the point x_k is symmetric to x_{99 - k} as -x_k. Similarly, the 50th point would be at -10 + 50*(20/99). Let me check 50*(20/99) ≈ 10.101..., which is beyond 0, so actually each x_k and x_{99 - k} sum to (-10 + k*20/99) + (-10 + (99 - k)*20/99) = -20 + (k*(20/99) + (99 -k)*(20/99)) = -20 + (99*(20/99)) = -20 + 20 = 0. So yes, each pair adds to zero, so they are symmetric around 0.\\n\\nTherefore, the points are symmetric about 0. That is a crucial piece of information. This symmetry may allow us to consider variables in terms of even and odd functions or maybe exploit some properties here.\\n\\nGiven the function f(x) = ax + b, when we take absolute values, but if we have symmetry, perhaps f(-x_k) = -a x_k + b. Hmm, not sure yet, maybe we need to consider how the absolute values interact here.\\n\\nLet me see, since the points are symmetric, maybe we can pair terms. For each pair of points x and -x (except possibly the point at x=0 if there was an odd number of points, but since there are 100, which is even, there\\'s no such point). So each pair is (x_k, -x_k). Therefore, the sum S(a,b) = sum_{k=0}^{99} |a x_k + b| can be written as sum_{k=0}^{49} [ |a x_{2k} + b| + |a x_{99 - 2k} + b| ]\\n\\nWait, actually, perhaps more systematically, let me think of the points arranged symmetrically. For each point at position x, there is a point at -x. So, for each pair, the two terms in the sum would be |a x + b| and | -a x + b|. So the sum over each pair would be |a x + b| + | -a x + b|. Thus, the total sum can be expressed as the sum over all these pairs. \\n\\nTherefore, if we can compute the sum over a single pair and multiply by the number of pairs, perhaps. Since there are 100 points, 50 pairs. Let\\'s check: 50 pairs of two points each sum to |a x + b| + | -a x + b|, so indeed.\\n\\nTherefore, the total S(a,b) = Σ_{x in X} (|a x + b| + | -a x + b|), where X is the set of points from the first half (excluding the second half, which are symmetric counterparts). But actually, since it\\'s symmetric, each pair is accounted once, so S = Σ_{x in X_not_including_0} [ |a x + b| + | -a x + b| ] + ... Wait, but maybe even simpler, since all points except maybe the center, but since even number of points, all are in pairs. So S(a,b) = Σ_{k=1 to 50} [ |a x_k + b| + | -a x_k + b| }, where x_k is the k-th positive point? Not exactly, but the idea is that each positive x has a corresponding negative x, except if 0 was there, but since 0 is included?\\n\\nWait, let me check exactly where the points are. The first point is at x0 = -10. Then x1 = -10 + 20/99, x2 = -10 + 2*(20/99)... up to x99 = -10 + 99*(20/99) = -10 +20 =10. Therefore, each pair x_k and x_{99 -k} are symmetric around 0. Specifically, for k from 0 to 99, x_{99 -k} = -x_k - (some small amount? Wait let\\'s compute it numerically.\\n\\nWait, x0 = -10, and x99 = 10, so xk + x_{99 -k} = (-10 + k*(20/99)) + (-10 + (99 -k)*(20/99)) = -20 + (k*(20/99) + (99 -k)*(20/99)) = -20 + (99*(20/99)) = -20 + 20 =0. So they are exact negatives of each other. So yes, x_{99 -k} = -x_k. \\n\\nTherefore, the points are perfectly symmetric about 0. So, for each k from 0 to 99, x_{99 -k} = -x_k. Therefore, the terms can be paired as (|a x_k + b| + | -a x_k + b|). \\n\\nTherefore, the total sum S(a,b) = sum_{k=0}^{99} |a x_k + b| = sum_{k=0}^{49} [ |a x_{2k} + b| + | -a x_{2k} + b| ] if the pairs are from different indices. Wait, perhaps the better way is to split the sum into two parts: sum_{k=0}^{99} |a xk + b| = sum_{k=0}^{49} [ |a xk + b| + |a x_{99 -k} + b| ] because when k goes from 0 to 49, 99 -k goes from 99 down to 50, so covering all pairs. \\n\\nSince x_{99−k} = -x_k, the sum over each pair becomes |a x + b| + | -a x + b|. \\n\\nSo in total, S(a, b) = Σ_{k=0}^{49} [ |a x_k + b| + | -a x_k + b| ]\\n\\nHmm, so that simplifies the expression a bit. Maybe I can consider this expression in terms of x and write it as sum_{k=0}^{49} [ |a x_k + b| + | -a x_k + b| }.\\n\\nAlternatively, let me consider a single pair term: |a x + b| + | -a x + b|. \\n\\nLet me denote y = a x, so that the expression becomes |y + b| + |- y + b| = |y + b| + |b - y|. \\n\\nThe sum of absolute values of (y + b) and (b - y). Let\\'s recall that |y + b| + |b - y| = 2 max(|b|, |y|) when b and y have the same sign?\\n\\nWait hold on, let\\'s compute for different cases. Let me think of |A| + |B| where A = b + y, B = b - y.\\n\\nDepending on the signs of A and B. Alternatively, note that |y + b| + | - y + b| is the same as |y + b| + |b - y|. This is similar to the expression |y + b| + |y - b|. Wait, not exactly same, but flipping variables. Let\\'s see: Let me write it as |(a x + b)| + | (-a x + b)|. \\n\\nAlternatively, think of variables: Let me set z = b, then the expression is |a x + z| + | -a x + z| = |a x + z| + |z - a x|, which is equal to |a x + z| + |z - a x|.\\n\\nHmm, that expression is the same as 2 times the maximum of |z| and |a x|? Let me check.\\n\\nSuppose z and a x are real numbers. Let me let A = z and B = a x. Then the expression is |A + B| + |A - B|.\\n\\nAh! Oh right! That\\'s a standard identity. For any real numbers A and B, |A + B| + |A - B| is equal to 2*max(|A|, |B|). Let me verify:\\n\\nIf A and B have the same sign, say both positive, then:\\n\\nIf A >= B, then A + B and A - B are both positive? Wait, no. Wait, let me suppose A and B are positive. Then A + B is positive, A - B is positive if A > B, otherwise negative? Wait, actually:\\n\\nWait, if A and B are both positive:\\n\\nIf A >= B, then |A + B| = A + B, |A - B| = A - B, so total is (A+B)+(A-B)=2A.\\n\\nIf A < B, then |A + B| = A+B, |A - B| = B - A, so total is (A+B)+(B - A)=2B.\\n\\nSimilarly, if A and B have opposite signs:\\n\\nSuppose A positive, B negative. Then A + B could be positive or negative, but let\\'s see:\\n\\nLet me write B = -C, where C positive.\\n\\nThen |A - C| + |A + C|. Wait, similar to before.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe better to note that in general, for any real numbers, |a + b| + |a - b| = 2 max(|a|, |b|).\\n\\nWait yes, that seems correct.\\n\\nWait let\\'s test with numbers:\\n\\nLet A = 3, B = 2: then |5| + |1| = 5 + 1 =6= 2*3 (since 3 > 2). Correct.\\n\\nA =2, B=3: 5 and |-1| = 5 +1 =6= 2*3. Correct.\\n\\nA=1, B= -2: | -1| + |3| = 1 + 3 =4= 2*2 (abs(-2)=2, which is larger). Correct.\\n\\nA = -2, B = 5: |3| + |-7|=3 +7=10= 2*5. Correct.\\n\\nGreat, so indeed, for any real numbers A,B:\\n\\n|A + B| + |A - B| = 2 * max(|A|, |B|).\\n\\nTherefore, in our case:\\n\\nFor each term in the pair: |a x_k + b| + | -a x_k + b| = 2* max(|b|, |a x_k| )\\n\\nTherefore, the total sum S(a,b) = Σ_{k=0}^{49} [ 2 * max(|b|, |a x_k| ) ] \\n\\nSince that\\'s for each pair (x_k, -x_k), so over all 50 pairs (since 100 points, so 50 pairs). Wait, but in the previous step, we had paired up the terms from k=0 to 49, so that\\'s 50 terms? Wait actually, in the pairing where for each k from 0 to 99, the pairs are (x_k, x_{99−k}), which gives 50 pairs. Therefore, the total sum is equal to Σ_{k=0}^{49} [ 2 * max(|b|, |a x_k| ) ]\\n\\nTherefore, the total sum S(a,b) = 2 * Σ_{k=0}^{49} max(|b|, |a x_k| )\\n\\nThat\\'s a critical simplification! \\n\\nTherefore, our constraint is:\\n\\n2 * Σ_{k=0}^{49} max(|b|, |a x_k| ) = 1000 ⇒ Σ_{k=0}^{49} max(|b|, |a x_k| ) = 500\\n\\nSo now, we need to maximize and minimize |b| given that the sum over k=0 to 49 of max(|b|, |a x_k|) equals 500. Maybe we can set variables in terms of |b|. Let me denote b0 = |b| (assuming b is positive; if b can be negative, then it\\'s symmetric because the problem involves absolute value of f(0), which is the same for b and -b. So WLOG, we can assume b ≥0, since if b is negative, we can flip the sign of a and b to make b positive without changing the sum S(a, b). Because f(x) = ax + b and |-ax - b| = |a(-x) + (-b)|. Wait, but since we have paired terms (x and -x), maybe flipping the sign would lead to the same sum. So yes, we can WLOG assume that b ≥0.\\n\\nTherefore, let me set b ≥ 0, and since |b| = b. So the problem reduces to:\\n\\nFind M = max{ b | Σ_{k=0}^{49} max(b, |a x_k|) = 500 }, and m = min{ b | same }, then M - m.\\n\\nWait, but actually, since b can also be negative, but |b| is to be maximized or minimized. However, since max(|b|, |a x_k|) = max(|b|, |a x_k|) regardless of the sign. But since we are to maximize and minimize |b|, perhaps we can consider b ≥0 as the case where |b| = b, and then m would be 0 (if possible?), but not sure. Wait, maybe.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps there\\'s some relation between a and b.\\n\\nAlso, the variables a and b can be any real numbers, except that the sum must hold. So, the problem is to choose a and b (real numbers) such that Σ_{k=0}^{49} max(b, |a x_k|) =500 (since S(a,b) must equal 1000 and we set b positive WLOG) and find the maximum and minimum possible values of b, then take their difference.\\n\\nHmm, perhaps to maximize b, we need to have that in as many terms of the sum as possible, the max(b, |a x_k|) is equal to b. Because then the sum would be 50 terms of b, which is 50b, but 50b must equal 500 ⇒ b=10. Wait, but can we have max(b, |a x_k|)=b for all k?\\n\\nOnly if b ≥ |a x_k| for all k from 0 to 49. Let me see: The maximum x_k among the first 50 points (since we started counting from 0 to 99, the first 50 points x_0 to x_{49} go from -10 up to some value. Wait actually, the x_k for k from 0 to 49:\\n\\nEach x_k = -10 + k*(20/99). So starting from x0 = -10, and up to x_{49} = -10 + 49*(20)/99.\\n\\nCompute value at k=49:\\n\\n-10 + (49*20)/99 = -10 + (980)/99 ≈ -10 + 9.9 ≈ -0.1? Wait, that\\'s actually 980/99 ≈ 9.9, so -10 + 9.9 ≈ -0.1. Wait, that can\\'t be right. Wait, 49*20 = 980, 980/99 ≈ 9.9 (since 99*9.898≈980). So yes, so x_{49} ≈ -10 + 9.9 ≈ -0.1, close to zero. While x_{50} would be 0.1, and so on. Wait, but since we are considering the first 50 points (k from 0 to 49), up to x_{49} ≈ -0.1, so all these x_k are negative (since k=0, x0=-10; up to k=49, x49≈-0.1). Therefore, the terms |a x_k| ≈ |a*(-0.1)| just before turning positive. \\n\\nWait, however, the x\\'s for k from 0 to 49 are all on the negative side (since the first 50 points are from -10 up to just below 0). But even so, |a x_k| is |a| * |x_k|. The maximum |x_k| in the first 50 terms is at k=0, which is 10 (since x0=-10, so |x0|=10). So the largest |x_k| is 10. So, the maximum of |a x_k| over all k would be |a|*10. \\n\\nTherefore, the condition that max(b, |a x_k|) = b for all k is equivalent to requiring that b ≥ |a|*x_max, where x_max is the maximum |x_k|. Since the x\\'s go from -10 up to almost 0, so the maximum |x_k| is 10 (at x0). \\n\\nTherefore, to have b ≥ |a|*10. If that holds, then all terms in the sum would be max(b, |a x_k|) = b, so the total sum would be 50*b =500 ⇒ b=10. \\n\\nTherefore, this is possible only if we can choose a such that |a| ≤ b /10 = 10 /10=1. Since b=10 here. Wait, so is this possible?\\n\\nWait, in this scenario, choosing a such that |a| ≤ 1. Let\\'s set a as zero? If a is zero, then f(x)=b, so |f(x)| is always |b|, so the total sum would be 100* b = 1000 ⇒ b=10. Ah, so if we set a=0 and b=10, then the function is constant 10 over all x, so the sum would indeed be 100*10=1000, so that works. Therefore, the maximum possible |f(0)| = b is 10? Wait, but hold on: If we set a to be not zero but with |a|≤1, then the function would not be constant, but the |a x_k| would still be less than or equal to |a|*10 ≤1*10 =10, so if b=10, then max(b, |a x_k|)=10 for all k, so the sum would still be 50*10 *2? Wait wait, hold on.\\n\\nWait, actually, let me recap the sum again. Earlier, I had S(a,b) = 2 * Σ_{k=0}^{49} max(b, |a x_k|). So in order to get S=1000, that requires Σ_{k=0}^{49} max(b, |a x_k|) =500. If in all terms, max(b, |a x_k|)=b, then the sum is 50*b=500 ⇒ b=10, and that requires b ≥ |a||x_k| for all k. The maximum |x_k| in the points where k goes from 0 to 49 (the first 50) is 10 (the first point x0=-10). Therefore, the maximum |a x_k| in those terms is |a|*10. Hence, b must be at least |a|*10. To have equality, if we set b=10, then as long as |a| ≤1.\\n\\nAlternatively, even if a is non-zero, as long as |a| ≤1, then |a x_k| ≤10, which is equal to b, so max(b, |a x_k|)=b. Thus, in that case, the sum gives exactly 50*10=500. Therefore, indeed, if we set a=0 and b=10, we have the required sum. However, we can also have non-zero a with smaller magnitude. However, this shows that 10 is achievable. \\n\\nTherefore, M, the maximum possible |f(0)| is 10?\\n\\nWait, but maybe there\\'s a way to get a higher b?\\n\\nWait, suppose we don\\'t have b ≥ |a x_k| for all x_k, so that some terms in the sum will have max(b, |a x_k|) = |a x_k|. If that\\'s the case, perhaps we can have b larger? Let\\'s see. Wait, but if we set b higher, then the terms where |a x_k| < b will still contribute b, while those with |a x_k| ≥ b will contribute |a x_k|. So maybe by having some of the terms contribute more (i.e., when |a x_k| is large), maybe the total sum can stay low, allowing for a higher b?\\n\\nWait, let me try to work this out.\\n\\nSuppose, for example, we set a to be negative, then, since the points x_k for first 50 are all negative (from -10 to ~-0.1), the term a x_k would be positive (since a is negative and x is negative). So |a x_k| would be equal to |a|*|x_k|, regardless of the sign. \\n\\nAlternatively, suppose we have some other arrangement where |a x_k| can be made larger than b for some terms. Let\\'s see.\\n\\nSuppose we set a very large, but then maybe b is also set very large? Wait but how does that play?\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum M is 10, achieved when all terms in the sum give b, which requires that b must be the maximum of all |a x_k|. So to make b maximum, we just set all max(b, |a x_k|) equal to b and set b as large as possible. But actually, if we set a=0, then that is possible. Alternatively, if a is non-zero, but then b has to be at least |a|*x_max (x_max=10). So to maximize b, we set a=0 so that |a|*x_max=0, so set b to be as large as possible, but the constraint is such that with a=0, the sum is 100*b=1000 ⇒ b=10. So in that case, the maximum is 10. But is there a way to get a larger b?\\n\\nSuppose instead that we set a such that some terms have |a x_k| larger than b. For example, suppose we let a be very large, but set b less than |a x_k| for some terms. However, since the sum would then include some terms contributing |a x_k| instead of b. Therefore, to make the total sum equal to 1000, we need to see whether we can have b larger than 10? Let me test with an example.\\n\\nSuppose we set a very large, but let me see:\\n\\nSuppose we set a such that |a x_0| = |a*(-10)| =10|a|, so the first term |a x_0| would be 10|a|. Let me say we set b = 20. Wait but we need to set 10|a| < b (if we want to have some terms with b as max?) or larger?\\n\\nWait perhaps to get a larger b, but since in the terms where |a x_k| is large, but then the contribution to the sum would be larger than b, allowing us to have a higher b only if the other terms compensate?\\n\\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled, let me think of a different approach.\\n\\nLet me suppose we want to maximize b.\\n\\nTo maximize b, we need to arrange that as many terms as possible in the sum have max(b, |a x_k|)=b, and have as few terms as possible have max(b, |a x_k|)=|a x_k|. Because if a term has the max equal to |a x_k|, that term would contribute more to the sum than b would if b were less. Wait, no, if |a x_k| > b, then that term would contribute |a x_k| instead of b. So in order to keep the total sum fixed at 500 (since Σ max(b, |a x_k|) must equal 500), if we have terms that instead of contributing b contribute something larger, then the terms that contribute larger amounts need to be offset by some smaller terms? Wait, actually, no. If we have some terms contributing more, the total would be too big. To get the total exactly 500, if I set b higher, but then some terms contribute even more, the total sum would exceed 500. Therefore, perhaps in order to have a higher b, we need that those terms where |a x_k| exceeds b are balanced by terms where |a x_k| is smaller, but since x_k go from -10 up to nearly 0 in the first half, if a is positive or negative.\\n\\nHmm.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe to maximize b, the best is indeed when all the terms give max(b, |a x_k|)=b, so that we can set b as high as 10, as before. Because if in some terms the max is |a x_k|, then that would require those terms to be contributing more, so that to keep the total at 500, one has to make b smaller. But if we can set it so that all terms give b, then b can be as high as possible. \\n\\nHence, the maximum |f(0)| is 10. \\n\\nNow for the minimum m, that\\'s the smallest possible |b|. So, how small can b get? We need to adjust a and b so that the sum of the maximums is 500, but with b as small as possible. \\n\\nTo minimize |b|, which is equivalent to minimizing b (assuming again b non-negative), so set b as small as possible.\\n\\nIn order to minimize b, we need the sum Σ_{k=0}^{49} max(b, |a x_k|) =500 to be achieved with as small as possible b. To make the sum larger, if possible?\\n\\nWait, actually, if b is small, then the terms where |a x_k| are larger than b will contribute |a x_k|, while those with |a x_k| <b will contribute b. Since we want the total sum to be exactly 500, if we can have as many terms as possible contribute smaller values, then maybe we can minimize b. Wait, but smaller contributions would require a smaller total sum. Since the desired sum is 500, perhaps to minimize b, we need to have as much of the terms as possible contribute |a x_k|, so that even though those a terms might be larger, but then balanced?\\n\\nWait, let me think. Since the sum has to be 500, and the min(b, something) is not exactly – we have to maximize between b and |a x_k|.\\n\\nWait to minimize b, we can have b as small as possible, even zero? Let\\'s see.\\n\\nSuppose b is 0. Then the sum would be Σ_{k=0}^{49} max(0, |a x_k| ). But since |a x_k| is non-negative, this is equal to Σ_{k=0}^{49} |a x_k|.\\n\\nBut that must equal 500. However, since each x_k in the first 50 points (from -10 to nearly 0), but the absolute value |x_k| will go from 10 down to ~0.1 (since the 50th point was x49 ~ -0.1). Wait, but in reality, the exact points: x0 = -10, x1= -10 +20/99 ≈ -9.797..., up to x49≈ -0.101 (since the step size is 20/99≈0.202, so the first 50 terms go from -10 to -10 +49*(20/99)= -10 + (980)/99≈-10 +9.898≈ -0.102. So their absolute values |x_k| = 10, 9.797, ..., up to ~0.102. \\n\\nSo if b=0, then the sum would be the sum over all k=0 to 49 of |a x_k|, but multiplied by 2? Wait, hold on, actually:\\n\\nWait, S(a,b) = sum_{all points} |a x +b|. When we split into pairs, each pair contributes |a x +b| + | -a x +b|. \\n\\nIf b=0, the two terms in each pair become |a x| + | -a x | = 2|a x|.\\n\\nTherefore, the total sum would be 2 * Σ_{k=0}^{49} |a x_k|, which for b=0 must equal 1000. Therefore the sum over k=0 to49 of |a xk| must equal 500. \\n\\nTherefore, if b=0 and we set |a| such that the sum is 500, then that\\'s possible? Let me compute the sum of |x_k| over k=0 to49, then see what a would be.\\n\\nLet me denote S_x = Σ_{k=0}^{49} |x_k|. Since all x_k are negative in the first 50 points (k=0 to 49), so |x_k| = -x_k. Thus,\\n\\nS_x = Σ_{k=0}^{49} (-x_k) = Σ_{k=0}^{49} [10 - (20/99)k + 10? Wait, wait. Wait, x_k = -10 + (20/99) k for k from 0 to 99, but since k is from 0 to 49 here, each term is:\\n\\nWait actually, for the first 50 points, x_k from k=0 to49 go from -10 up to x49≈-0.1. Wait, so all x_k are negative, so |x_k|= -x_k. Hence, S_x = Σ_{k=0}^{49} (-x_k) = Σ_{k=0}^{49} [10 - ( (20/99)k - ...?), wait, let\\'s calculate properly.\\n\\nx_k = -10 + (20/99)*k. \\n\\nTherefore, |x_k| = |-10 + (20/99)*k | = 10 - (20/99)*k, because x_k is negative (since for k from 0 to 49, x_k = -10 + (20/99)*k < 0 )\\n\\nWait, let\\'s confirm:\\n\\nAt k=0: x0 = -10, so |x0|=10=10 -0.\\n\\nAt k=49: x_{49}= -10 + (20/99)*49 ≈-10 + 9.898 ≈-0.102, so |x_{49}|≡0.102≈10 - (20/99)*49 ≈10 - (980/99)=10 -9.9≈0.1. So yes, that formula holds.\\n\\nTherefore, S_x=Σ_{k=0}^{49} [10 - (20/99)k] \\n\\nThis is equal to Σ_{k=0}^{49} 10 - (20/99) Σ_{k=0}^{49}k \\n\\nFirst term: 50 terms of 10 ⇒ 50×10=500.\\n\\nSecond term: (20/99) times the sum from k=0 to49.\\n\\nSum_{k=0}^{49} k = (49)(50)/2 =1225.\\n\\nThus S_x = 500 - (20/99)(1225).\\n\\nCompute (20/99)*1225:\\n\\n20*1225=24,500; then divided by 99: ≈24500 /99≈247.474...\\n\\nSo S_x= 500 -247.474≈252.526...\\n\\nWait so S_x≈252.526.\\n\\nWait so if b=0, then the required sum Σ |a x_k| must equal 500, so |a|*(Σ |x_k|) = |a| * S_x =500 ⇒ |a|=500/S_x ≈500/252.526≈1.98.\\n\\nSo a ≈1.98, and then S(a,b)=2* Σ |a x_k| =2*( |a| * S_x )=2*(500)=1000. Perfect. \\n\\nWait, exactly. Wait because:\\n\\nWait wait, S(a,0) =2 * Σ_{k=0}^{49} max(0, |a x_k|) =2 * Σ_{k=0}^{49} |a x_k| = 2|a| S_x. So indeed, if set |a|=500/S_x, then the total S(a,0)=1000.\\n\\nTherefore, when b=0, this works. Thus, the minimal |b| can be 0.\\n\\nWait but hold on, is that possible?\\n\\nWait |f(0)| =|b|=0. But the problem says \"the sum of the absolute values of f(x) at 100 evenly spaced points is equal to 1000.\" So with b=0 and a=500/S_x, yes, that satisfies the condition, so that is allowed. So the minimal |f(0)| is 0?\\n\\nTherefore, then M - m=10 -0=10.\\n\\nBut wait the problem says \"the minimum possible value of |f(0)|\". If that can be zero, then that would be the case, but perhaps there is a mistake here.\\n\\nWait but let\\'s check more carefully.\\n\\nSuppose b=0 and a= (500/S_x). Then in this case, the function is f(x)=a x, and the sum is exactly 1000. The absolute value at each point is |a x_k|, so yes, which when multiplied over the points, gives the required value. But then |f(0)|=0. Therefore, m=0.\\n\\nTherefore, the difference is M - m =10-0=10.\\n\\nBut is that correct? Is there a lower bound higher than zero? Let me think.\\n\\nWait maybe the minimal |b| is zero, because when b=0, the function passes through the origin, and you can choose a slope such that the sum of absolute values is 1000. Which we just did, so that must be acceptable. Hence the minimum is indeed zero, so the answer is 10?\\n\\nWait, but the problem says \"a linear function f(x) = ax + b defined on the interval [-10,10]. \" There are no restrictions on a and b except the given condition on the sum. So, since it works with b=0, that\\'s acceptable, so m=0.\\n\\nHowever, the problem says \"the minimum possible value of |f(0)|\". Wait, but maybe if we allow b negative? However |f(0)| is absolute value, so |b|. Hence even if b is negative, the |f(0)| would still be non-negative. To minimize that, the minimum is zero. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in assuming the maximum is 10?\\n\\nWait let me confirm again with b=10 and a=0. Then f(x)=10. Then every absolute value term is 10, so times 100 is 1000, so that\\'s correct. Thus, that is allowed, so M is indeed 10. Thus, M - m is 10.\\n\\nBut wait the problem might have a trick here.\\n\\nWait let me think again. Maybe the maximum is higher?\\n\\nWait, suppose we set a negative; perhaps allows for larger b? Let me see.\\n\\nWait, for instance, suppose a is negative. Let\\'s think of the first 50 points which are negative x. Let me think of when the function f(x)=ax + b. If a is negative, then f(x_k)=a x_k +b. For x_k negative (in first half), so x_k negative, a negative makes a x_k positive, so f(x_k) = (a x_k) +b, with both terms positive (if a negative and x negative). Then the absolute value |f(x_k)| would be equal to ( -a |x_k| ) + b. \\n\\nHmm, maybe if we can arrange for the function to be positive over all sampled points, so that the absolute value can be removed, and so you can arrange coefficients such that b is higher?\\n\\nWait alternatively, maybe if we tilt the line so that it is above zero for all points, allowing b + a x to remain positive, hence avoiding the absolute value which could subtract?\\n\\nWait to maximize b, perhaps tilting the line such that in some points it\\'s minimal, allowing the maximum amount.\\n\\nWait, let me think again: To make b as large as possible, we want all the terms in the sum to be equal to b, so that we can maximize b. To ensure that, we need that b is greater than |a x_k| for all k. Since the maximum |x_k| is at 10 (the point x0=-10), so |a| *10 must be less than or equal to b. \\n\\nTo maximize b, set |a| *10 =b. Wait but if we set equality, then b= |a| *10, but then the first term\\'s maximum will be equal to b, but in the sum:\\n\\nWait let me think if we set a positive or negative.\\n\\nSuppose a is positive. Let me pick a as some positive value. Then, the maximum term at x0=-10 would be |a*(-10) + b|. If we want max(b, |a x0|)=b, then must have b ≥ |a x0|. Given x0=-10, |a x0|=10a, so need b ≥10a.\\n\\nBut if in this case, all terms will be max(b, a x_k\\'s absolute value). If we set b=10a, then to make sure that for other terms, |a x_k| ≤b?\\n\\nThe other x_k go from -10 to almost -0.1, so x_k has maximum absolute value at x0= -10. The other points have x closer to zero, so |x_k| is smaller, so |a x_k| will be smaller than 10a. Therefore, with b=10a, all max terms will be equal to b except maybe at x0? Let me see:\\n\\nWait for x0, |a x0 + b|. Since x0 is -10, so a x0 + b =a*(-10) +b = -10a +b. Since b=10a, this gives 10a -10a =0, so |0|=0. Wait, and max(b, |a x0|) ?\\n\\nWait, hold on, perhaps I got confused earlier. Wait the term max(b, |a x_k|) refers to the maximum between b and |a x_k|, independent of direction? Wait no, actually, the pairing term was |a x +b| + | -a x + b|, which equals 2 * max(b, |a x|). Wait, so when I set a positive, and x is negative, for example, then in the term for x0=-10, the first term would be |a*(-10) +b| and the second term would be |a*10 + b| (since the symmetric point is +10, so x_{99}=10). Wait but actually the pairings when you have x=-10 (x0) and x=10 (x99). Then their two terms are |a*(-10)+b| and |a*10 +b|. \\n\\nHence, when we derived earlier:\\n\\nFor each pair, the total contribution is 2 * max(b, |a x|), since x is any point in the positive or negative.\\n\\nTherefore, in the case where a is positive and b=10a, let\\'s consider x=10 (the rightmost point). Then for that pair (x=10 and x=-10), the term becomes max(b, |a*10|)= max(10a , 10a)=10a. Similarly, for x=10, the term would also be similar. Wait, but hang on, in our pairing approach:\\n\\nWait in the previous notation, when pairing points k and 99 -k, which are symmetric.\\n\\nThus, for the point x = -10 (k=0), the paired point is x=10 (k=99). The pair contributes:\\n\\n|a*(-10) +b| + |a*(10)+b|\\n\\nWe need this to be equal to 2 * max( b, |a*10| )\\n\\nWait, because in this case x is the absolute value of the original x. Wait, actually, the formula was using |a xk|, but in the pairing term, for the point x0=-10 and its pair x99=10, the center x is 10, so the formula is 2 * max(b, |a*10|). Similarly, any pair at a distance |x| from the center. \\n\\nWait so for the maximum at each pair\\'s distance is based on the absolute value of x. \\n\\nTherefore, if we take b = |a| * |x_max|. Since the maximum |x| is 10, so setting b =10 |a|, then at the point x=10 (and -10), the max(b, |a x|)=max(10|a|, 10 |a|)=10|a|. For any other point with |x_k| <10, then |a x_k| <10 |a| =b, so max(b, |a x_k|)=b. Therefore, the total sum would be:\\n\\nFor the pair at 10 and -10: contribution is 2*(10|a|). \\n\\nFor all other pairs (for which |x|<10), the contribution is 2*b =2*(10|a|) per pair?\\n\\nWait wait no. Wait:\\n\\nWait let me see. Take pairs further from zero:\\n\\nWait actually, for the pair at distance 9.8 (approx imate), the |x| is less than 10, so |a x_k| < b =10|a|, so for those pairs the contribution is 2*b. Only the very first pair (the endpoints) have their |a x| equal to b, hence contributing 2*(b). Wait actually, since |a x_max|=b at the maximum |x|. Wait, so the pairs at other |x| will also contribute 2*b. The pair at 10 will also contribute 2*b, since max(b, |a x|)=b. Because even at exactly |x|=10, the term is exactly equal to b. Hence all pairs contribute 2b, so total sum is 100*b / but since there are 50 pairs paired with each contributing 2 b ?\\n\\nWait, no: Wait actually, for all pairs, the contribution is 2*max(b, |a x_k|). Since with b= |a|*10, for all x_k, the |a x_k| is ≤ |a|*10 =b, so all those terms are max(b, ...) =b, so total sum:\\n\\n2 *sum_{k=0}^{49} b = 2*(50)*b =100b. But in our problem, the total must be 1000, so 100 b =1000 ⇒ b=10, with |a| = b /10 =1.\\n\\nAh! So, in this case, the total is 100b, so b must be 10. Therefore this reproduces the earlier result. So, when you set b =10, a can be +/-1, and the total sum will be 100*10=1000. \\n\\nAlternatively, if we set a=1, then at the points, the function is f(x)=x +10, which at the endpoints x=10, f(10)=20; f(-10)=0. Wait, so the absolute values would go from 20 down to... Wait in this case, for example:\\n\\nWait let\\'s check this function f(x)=x+10.\\n\\nAt x=10: f(10)=20 → |20|=20\\n\\nAt x=-10: f(-10)=0 → |0|=0\\n\\nWait, but according to our earlier logic, each pair x and -x would contribute |a x +b| + | -a x + b|.\\n\\nSo take the pair at x and -x:\\n\\nLet me take x=1 (then -x=-1). Then |1+10| + |-(-1)+10| Wait this might not matter, but in the example, f(x)=x +10, so for x=10:\\n\\nThe pair x=10 and x=-10 gives |10+10| + | -10 +10| = |20| + |0| =20 +0 =20.\\n\\nBut according to the formula, the contribution is 2*max(b, |a x|)=2*max(10, 10)=20, which is correct.\\n\\nSimilarly, for a point x=5 and x=-5: |5 +10| + |-5 +10|=15 +5 =20, which is 2*max(10, 5)=20. Correct.\\n\\nWait at x=0, though, since there is no central point, but when pairing, but since the points are symmetric, when x is close to 0, say the pair near 0: x≈-0.102 and 0.102. Then, their values are f(-0.1)=≈-0.1 +10≈9.9 and f(0.1)=0.1 +10≈10.1. The sum of absolute values is ~9.9+10.1 ≈20, while 2* max(10, |a x|)=2*max(10, 0.1) =20. Correct. \\n\\nThus, for f(x)=x+10, all terms in the sum of absolute values equal to 20 per pair? Wait no, each pair contributes 20? Hmm, Wait, when you have b=10 and a=1, each pair x and -x has:\\n\\nTotal contribution is |a x + b| + | -a x + b| = |x +10| + |-x +10|.\\n\\nWhen x is positive, that\\'s (x+10 + (10 -x)) since |-x +10|=10 - (-x)? Wait:\\n\\nWait x is here the  coordinate. Let me take x positive:\\n\\nSuppose x>0:\\n\\nThen |x +10| =x+10 (since x+10 is always positive).\\n\\n| -x +10|= |10 -x|. \\n\\nThus the total is:\\n\\nIf 10 -x >=0 → x ≤10:\\n\\nThen total =x +10 + (10 -x)=20.\\n\\nIf x>10, but in our case x only up to 10.\\n\\nAt x=10: |10+10| + | -10 +10|=20 +0=20.\\n\\nHence all pairs when a=1 and b=10 will contribute exactly 20. Since there are 50 pairs (since 100 points), so 50*20=1000, which is correct. Therefore, indeed this case gives exactly the desired sum, and |f(0)|= |10|, which is the maximum.\\n\\nBut also, if a= -1 and b=10, then f(x)= -x +10. Then, at the point x=10, f(10) = -10 +10=0, and at x= -10, f(-10)=10 +10=20. The contributions would similarly be 20 for each pair, so that still works, and |f(0)|=10.\\n\\nTherefore, the maximum possible |f(0)| is indeed 10.\\n\\nSimilarly, the minimum |f(0)| is 0, as we saw when we set a such that b=0. Hence M−m=10−0=10. \\n\\nWait, but hold on, perhaps there\\'s a mistake here. When I considered b=0, which is allowed, then m would be zero. However, someone might question whether b can indeed be zero, but the problem states the linear function is defined on the interval. The problem doesn\\'t forbid b from being zero. Therefore, the minimal value is 0. \\n\\nBut I have a nagging doubt because sometimes in optimization problems with absolute values, there may constraints I missed.\\n\\nWait let me check with another case where b is smaller than zero?\\n\\nBut since the minimal is taken as absolute value of f(0), which is |b|, hence |-5|=5 is larger than 0, so definitely zero is the minimum.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps there\\'s a restriction that a cannot be too large? But in the case when b is zero, the slope a is 500/S_x ≈1.98, which is a valid real number. Hence, no problem.\\n\\nWait but to be precise, let me compute the exact value of S_x instead of approximate. Let\\'s recast the sum S_x = Σ_{k=0}^{49} (10 - (20/99)k )\\n\\nWait, S_x = 50*10 - (20/99) * Σ_{k=0}^{49}k\\n\\nΣ_{k=0}^{49}k is (49)(50)/2=1225\\n\\nS_x = 500 - (20/99)(1225) =500 - (24500)/99 \\n\\n24500 divided by 99: 24500 / 99= 247.474747...\\n\\nTherefore, 500 -247.4747≈252.5252...\\n\\nThus, the precise value of |a| when b=0 must be 500 / 252.5252≈1.98, which is okay.\\n\\nTherefore, conclusion remains the same: M−m is 10. \\n\\nHowever, maybe there is a different configuration where you can get a lower |b|? Wait but b is already zero, which is the minimum. So, perhaps the answer is \\\\boxed{10}. \\n\\nWait, but before I saw an initial thought that the maximum is 10 and the minimum is 0, but maybe my initial approach missed something?\\n\\nWait let me think of a different perspective: perhaps the function has to cross zero, so |b| can\\'t actually be zero? \\n\\nWait, but when b=0 and a non-zero, the function passes through the origin but still the sum condition is satisfied. There\\'s no condition that the function has to be strictly above or below zero. The absolute values can handle negative values. So if at some points f(x)=a x +0 is negative, but its absolute value is taken, so it\\'s okay. Therefore, b can indeed be zero, leading to a sum of the absolute value. Therefore, the minimal |b| is 0.\\n\\nTherefore, unless the problem has some hidden constraint (which is not mentioned), the answer should be 10.\\n\\nBut maybe I need to check with a different example. Suppose b=5 and a= some value.\\n\\nWait, to see in between. Let\\'s say b=5. Then, for the first term (the far left point x=-10), the term would be max(5, |a*(-10)| ). If we choose a such that |a|*10 >5, then that term would contribute |a|*10 which might be larger. But then to compensate, other terms could be smaller?\\n\\nAlternatively, the total sum needs to be 500. Let me choose a set of a and b where b is between 0 and 10 to see.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in assuming that the minimum is 0?\\n\\nSuppose we set b=0, but in that case, as above, the minimal |b| can be zero, so that\\'s okay.\\n\\nAlternatively, the question says \"the sum of the absolute values of f(x) at 100 evenly spaced points in the interval is equal to 1000\".\\n\\nSo, all is correct. Therefore, the answer is 10-0=10.\\n\\nBut I recall in some similar problems, sometimes M -m comes out differently.\\n\\nWait let me verify with a different function where b is minimal.\\n\\nTake b approaching 0 from above. For example, set b=epsilon→0.\\n\\nThen the total sum would be ~ Σ max(epsilon, |a x_k| )≈ Σ |a x_k|, so set a= 500/S_x≈1.9802 as before.but then |f(0)|=b≈0, so the lower limit is indeed zero.\\n\\nThus since possible to reach zero, and that is the minimal, the difference is 10. \\n\\nAlternatively, the problem might have M and m regarding the maximum and minimum over all a and b real numbers. Since b can be set as high as 10, and as low as 0. Hmm, but since they ask for |f(0)|, so the absolute value, so the minimal |f(0)| is 0, maximum is 10. So the answer is 10. \\n\\nAlternatively, is there any restriction that the linear function must be non-constant? No, because a can be zero, making it constant. In that case, f(x)=10 is a valid function, which gives |f(0)|=10 and sum 1000, so it\\'s allowed.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires the linear function to be non-horizontal? But no, it just says linear.\\n\\nTherefore, I think my conclusion is right, so the answer is 10.\\n\\nWait, but just to ensure, let me see if I have interpreted the number of points correctly. The function is defined on [-10,10], with 100 evenly spaced points. The number of intervals is 99, hence the spacing is 20/99. So points are at x = -10 + k*(20/99) for k=0,…,99. So that\\'s 100 points, yes. Therefore symmetric as I thought.\\n\\nAdditionally, maximum at b=10, the minimum at b=0, difference is 10.\\n\\nThus I think the answer is 10, and I will go with that.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\\\boxed{10}\\n</think>\\n\\nGiven a linear function \\\\( f(x) = ax + b \\\\) defined on the interval \\\\([-10, 10]\\\\) with the condition that the sum of the absolute values of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) at 100 evenly spaced points is 1000, we need to find the difference between the maximum and minimum possible values of \\\\(|f(0)|\\\\).\\n\\n1. **Understanding the Points and Symmetry**:\\n   - The interval \\\\([-10, 10]\\\\) is divided into 100 evenly spaced points, which are symmetric around 0. Each point \\\\(x_k\\\\) has a corresponding point \\\\(-x_k\\\\).\\n   - The sum of the absolute values can be paired into terms involving \\\\(x_k\\\\) and \\\\(-x_k\\\\), leading to the expression \\\\( |ax_k + b| + | -ax_k + b| \\\\).\\n\\n2. **Simplifying the Sum**:\\n   - For each pair \\\\( (x_k, -x_k) \\\\), the expression \\\\( |ax_k + b| + | -ax_k + b| \\\\) simplifies to \\\\( 2 \\\\max(|b|, |ax_k|) \\\\).\\n   - The total sum \\\\( S(a, b) \\\\) becomes \\\\( 2 \\\\sum_{k=0}^{49} \\\\max(|b|, |a x_k|) \\\\).\\n\\n3. **Maximizing \\\\( |f(0)| \\\\)**:\\n   - To maximize \\\\(|b|\\\\), set \\\\( b \\\\) as large as possible. This occurs when \\\\( \\\\max(|b|, |a x_k|) = b \\\\) for all \\\\(k\\\\), which requires \\\\( b \\\\geq |a x_k| \\\\) for all \\\\(x_k\\\\).\\n   - The maximum \\\\(|x_k|\\\\) is 10, hence \\\\( b \\\\geq 10|a| \\\\). Setting \\\\( |a| = 1 \\\\) and \\\\( b = 10 \\\\) satisfies the condition with the sum being \\\\( 1000 \\\\), giving \\\\( M = 10 \\\\).\\n\\n4. **Minimizing \\\\( |f(0)| \\\\)**:\\n   - To minimize \\\\(|b|\\\\), set \\\\( b = 0 \\\\). The sum then becomes \\\\( \\\\sum_{k=0}^{99} |ax_k| \\\\).\\n   - Setting \\\\( b = 0 \\\\), we solve for \\\\(a\\\\) such that the sum \\\\( \\\\sum_{k=0}^{99} |ax_k| = 1000 \\\\). Calculations show this is possible with \\\\( a \\\\approx 1.98 \\\\), leading to \\\\(|f(0)| = 0 \\\\).\\n\\n5. **Conclusion**:\\n   - The maximum value \\\\( M \\\\) is \\\\( 10 \\\\) and the minimum value \\\\( m \\\\) is \\\\( 0 \\\\). Thus, the difference \\\\( M - m = 10 - 0 = 10 \\\\).\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{10}\\n\\\\]',\n",

Assuming this pattern continues, what is the largest power of 3 that divides the sum of the digits of \\\\(333,\\\\!333^2\\\\)?\"\\n\\nWait, hold on. First, let me check the examples they gave because maybe there\\'s a pattern there that can help me figure out the next one.\\n\\nStarting with \\\\(3^2\\\\). That\\'s 9, and the sum of the digits is 9, which is divisible by 9, so that\\'s 3². Then, for \\\\(33^2\\\\), I need to calculate that first.\\n\\nLet me compute \\\\(33^2\\\\). 33 times 33. Hmm, 30 squared is 900, plus 2*30*3 = 180, plus 3 squared is 9. So total is 900 + 180 + 9 = 1089. The sum of the digits: 1 + 0 + 8 + 9 = 18? Wait, but the problem says 27. Hmm, that doesn\\'t add up. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\\n\\nWait, 33 squared. Let me do it step by step. 33 multiplied by 33. 33 times 30 is 990, plus 33 times 3 is 99, so 990 + 99 is 1089. So digits are 1, 0, 8, 9. So sum is 1 + 0 + 8 + 9 = 18. But the problem statement says it\\'s 27. Hmm, that\\'s conflicting. Maybe the problem statement was referring to a different number? Wait, hold on, \"the sum of the digits of 33 squared is 27\". Hmm, perhaps a typo? Or maybe I miscalculated?\\n\\nWait, let me check online maybe, like 33 squared is 1089, so sum is 18? Wait, 1+0+8+9 is 18. Hmm, so maybe the problem statement is wrong? But maybe I need to check the third one as well. Let\\'s see: the sum of the digits of 333 squared is supposed to be 54. Let\\'s compute 333 squared.\\n\\n333 squared: (300 + 33)^2. Alternatively, 333 * 333. Let\\'s do it step by step.\\n\\n333 times 300 is 99,900. 333 times 30 is 9,990. 333 times 3 is 999. Adding them together: 99,900 + 9,990 is 109,890, plus 999 is 110,889. The digits of 110,889 are 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 9. The sum is 1 + 1 + 0 + 8 + 8 + 9 = 27. Wait, that\\'s 27, but the problem says 54. Hmm, so now I\\'m confused. Maybe they squared 333 incorrectly?\\n\\nHold on, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate 333 squared. Let\\'s do it using the formula (a + b)^2 where a is 300 and b is 33. Wait, no, actually 333 is 3*111, so maybe another approach?\\n\\nAlternatively, use standard multiplication:\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003333\\n\\n×\\u202f333\\n\\n--------\\n\\nFirst, multiply 333 by 3: 999\\n\\nThen, 333 by 30: 9990 (with a zero at the end)\\n\\nThen, 333 by 300: 99900 (with two zeros at the end)\\n\\nNow adding them together:\\n\\n999\\n\\n+9990\\n\\n= 10989\\n\\n+99900\\n\\n=110,889. Same as before. So that\\'s still 110,889. Sum of digits: 1 + 1 + 0 + 8 + 8 + 9 = 27? Yeah, that\\'s 27, but the problem says 54. Hmm, discrepancy here. Maybe it\\'s a different number?\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written with commas as thousand separators, so maybe 333,333 is 333333 without the comma? Wait, no, but the problem says \"333,333 squared\". Wait, perhaps in the problem statement there was a typo. Wait, maybe the original examples have different numbers? Wait, let me check the problem again.\\n\\n\"The sum of the digits of \\\\(3^2\\\\) is 9, which is divisible by 3; the sum of the digits of \\\\(33^2\\\\) is 27, which is divisible by 3 but not by 9; and the sum of the digits of \\\\(333^2\\\\) is 54, which is divisible by both 3 and 9.\"\\n\\nWait a second: if the problem says the sum is 54 for 333 squared, but my calculation gives 27, perhaps there\\'s a misunderstanding here. Maybe the number is not 333 but more 3s? Let me check.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the problem said 3333^2? Let me try that. Let me compute 3333 squared. That\\'s going to be larger, so let me see.\\n\\nBut maybe the problem has a mistake, or perhaps the user made a typo. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I\\'m miscalculating.\\n\\nWait, maybe the first example, 3^2 = 9, sum of digits is 9, which is divisible by 3. Then next case, 33^2 = 1089, which does have sum 18, which is divisible by 9 as well. Then 333^2: 27 or 54? Hmm, so if the problem says that 33^2 had digit sum 27, which is divisible by 3 but not by 9, but 18 is divisible by both. Wait, maybe the problem is misstated? Or perhaps they meant the digit product? No, that wouldn\\'t make sense.\\n\\nWait, maybe in their example, they considered that 33 is 3 digits? Wait 3 squared, 33 squared, 333 squared. Wait 3 has one 3, 33 has two 3s, 333 has three 3s. Then the examples go like:\\n\\nDigits of (3)^2: sum is 9 (div by 3 and 9)\\n\\nDigits of (33)^2: sum is 27 (div by 3, not by 9). Wait but that contradicts my calculation. Wait 27 is divisible by 9. 27 is 3³, so it\\'s divisible by both. Hmm, so maybe there\\'s confusion here.\\n\\nWait 1089: 1 + 0 + 8 + 9 is 18. 18 is divisible by 3 (1+8=9) so it is divisible by 9 as well. Hmm, so the problem\\'s second example says \"divisible by 3 but not by 9\" which is not true for 18. So that\\'s an error. Alternatively, maybe the problem meant 333^2\\'s digit sum is 27 instead of 54. Wait, but according to my calculation, 333 squared is 110,889, whose digit sum is 27, which is divisible by 9. Hmm.\\n\\nWait, maybe the problem had 3, then 33, then 333, so the digit counts 1, 2, 3. Then their results are 9, 27, and 54? That would imply for the nth 3\\'s squared, digit sum is 9n, but 3 has one 3, 3^2 sum is 9, which would be 9*1. 33 has two 3s, but their digit sum is 18? So maybe there is inconsistency here.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the problem was supposed to have 333^2 leading to 54, so there\\'s a contradiction. Hmm, so perhaps there was a mistake in the problem\\'s wording. Since I can\\'t edit the problem, perhaps I need to work with the given statements.\\n\\nAssuming that the pattern they refer to continues, so according to the problem statement:\\n\\n- For 3^2, sum is 9 (3^2)\\n- For 33^2, sum is 27 (3^3)\\n- For 333^2, sum is 54 (which is 3^3 * 2, so the highest power of 3 dividing it is 27, which is 3^3)\\n\\nSo they might be following a pattern where the exponent on 3 in the digit sum increases as the number grows? Wait in the first case, 9 is 3², then 27 is 3³, then 54 is 3³ * 2, so highest power is still 3³? Hmm, maybe there\\'s inconsistency here.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants the largest power of 3 that divides the digit sum, then for 3^2 (digit sum 9): 3², divides, 3^3 doesn\\'t. For 33^2, it\\'s 27, so 3^3 divides it, 3^4 doesn\\'t. For 333^2, it\\'s 54 divided by 3 is 18, divided by 3 is 6, so 54 is 3³ * 2. So the largest power of 3 dividing it is 27, so 3³. Wait, but 54 divided by 3³ is 2. So yeah, highest power is 27. Wait the problem says for 333 squared it\\'s divisible by both, so that is 3^3 divides 54. So then maybe the pattern is the digit sum is 9 * 3^{n-1} where n is the number of 3s? Let\\'s see.\\n\\nWait 1 three: 3^2 digit sum 9 = 9*1 = 9*3^0\\n\\n2 threes: 33 squared, digit sum 27 = 9*3^1\\n\\n3 threes: 333 squared, digit sum 54 = 9*3^2 = 81? Wait no, 54 is not 81. Hmm. Wait, perhaps my initial premises are off here.\\n\\nAlternatively perhaps the digit sum is following some other pattern. Let me recast this problem.\\n\\nWait let me first see 3 numbers here:\\n\\nFirst number: 3 (1 three), squared 9, digit sum 9.\\n\\nSecond number: 33 (two threes), squared 1089, digit sum is 1+0+8+9=18. Hmm, but problem says 27. Wait, perhaps problem is incorrect. Alternatively maybe they used a different example. Wait maybe 333 squared has different number?\\n\\nAlternatively maybe the number is not 333, but 3333? Let me see. Let me compute 333 squared again. 333*333. I think I did it right. Let me confirm with calculator.\\n\\n333*333:\\n\\n333 × 333 = ?\\n\\nWell, 333 × 300 = 99,900\\n\\n333 × 30 = 9,990\\n\\n333 ×3 = 999\\n\\nAdding them together: 99,900 + 9,990 is 109,890; plus 999 is 110,889. So digits 1+1+0+8+8+9 = 27. So that\\'s correct. 27 is 3³. But problem says \"divisible by both 3 and 9\"—well 27 is divisible by both 3 and 9. Hmm. Then why in the problem statement they mention \"divisible by both\", but okay, it\\'s okay. Wait the problem didn\\'t say anything about higher exponents? Let\\'s see. Maybe the problem has a typo, but perhaps in the problem statement, the digit sum of 333 squared is supposed to be 54 instead of 27? Maybe I need to see where 54 would come from.\\n\\nWait if 333, with three 3s squared, the result has a digit sum of 54, that would mean that for each number of 3s n, the digit sum is 9*n*3? Hmm, with n=1, 9*2? Wait maybe another pattern.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe they actually meant different numbers?\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to numbers like 3, 33, 333..., so each digit three is length 1,2,3 etc., and the square of those numbers, the digit sums are 9, 27, 81, etc., so tripling each time. Then 9, 27, 81, which would be 3^2, 3^3, 3^4... so 3^{n+1}. But my calculation for three 3s gives 27 which is 3^3. So for n=1, 3^{3}, n=2, 3^{3}? Hmm that doesn\\'t fit. Wait inconsistency again.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe there was a mistake in the problem\\'s examples. Maybe the digit sum of 33 squared is actually 18, and the problem is considering that 18 is divisible by 3 but not by 9? Which is not true, so that can\\'t be.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps they made a mistake in their digit sum for 33^2, writing 27 instead of 18. If the problem\\'s examples have an error, then it\\'s hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem.\\n\\nWait let me reread it again.\\n\\n\"the sum of the digits of \\\\(3^2\\\\) is 9, which is divisible by 3; the sum of the digits of \\\\(33^2\\\\) is 27, which is divisible by 3 but not by 9; and the sum of the digits of \\\\(333^2\\\\) is 54, which is divisible by both 3 and 9\".\\n\\nHmm, so the problem\\'s first example: 3 squared\\'s digit sum is 9, which is divisible by 3. Wait, 9 is also divisible by 9, so they are only mentioning it\\'s divisible by 3. The second example: 33 squared\\'s digit sum is 27, which is divisible by 3 but not by 9? That contradicts, since 27 is divisible by 9. So perhaps the problem is wrong here, but maybe in the second case it\\'s supposed to be divisible by 3 but not by 27? But even 27 is divisible by 27, so that wouldn\\'t make sense. Hmm, confusion.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps \"divisible by 3 but not by 9\" is a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct in their examples but my calculation is wrong.\\n\\nWait I need to make sure my calculation for 33 squared is correct because if it\\'s wrong, then I can\\'t proceed.\\n\\nWait 33 squared: 33 × 33. Let me do it step by step.\\n\\n33\\n\\n× 33\\n\\n--------\\n\\n3 × 3 = 9 (units place)\\n\\n3 × 3 (tens place) = 9\\n\\nThen next row, shifted one position:\\n\\n3 ×3 = 9\\n\\n3 × 3 (tens place) =9\\n\\nWait, no, actually, perhaps long multiplication:\\n\\n       33\\n\\n     × 33\\n\\n     -----\\n\\n       99   (this is 33 × 3)\\n\\n     +990   (this is 33 × 30), so shifted left by one)\\n\\n     -----\\n\\n     1089\\n\\nSo indeed, 1089, so digits 1,0,8,9. Therefore, digit sum is 1+0+8+9=18. Therefore, 18. Which is divisible by 9 (sum of digits of 18 is 9). So the problem\\'s statement says the digit sum is 27 for 33^2. So that must be an error in the problem.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps it\\'s 3^3 squared. 3 cubed is 27, so squaring that, (3^3)^2=3^6=729, and the digit sum is 729\\'s digits 7+2+9=18, again 18. Hmm, no.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe they meant (33...3)^2 where there are n 3s, and the digit sum is 9 × 3^(n-1). For n=1: 9 ×1=9 (OK). For n=2: 9×3=27 (but actually 18). For n=3: 9×9=81, but actual digit sum is 27. So that doesn\\'t match. Hmm.\\n\\nWait, perhaps there\\'s a pattern here with more numbers.\\n\\nWait, let me compute the digit sum for the next one: 3333 squared. Let\\'s see:\\n\\nIf n=4, then 3333 squared. Maybe the digit sums progress as 9, 18, 27, 36...? Let\\'s see:\\n\\nLet me calculate 3333 squared:\\n\\n3333 × 3333.\\n\\nHmm, this might take time.\\n\\nAlternatively, note that (sum_{k=1 to n} 3*10^{k-1}) squared?\\n\\nWait, maybe there\\'s a pattern here when squaring numbers with all 3\\'s. Let me think.\\n\\nLet me denote N_n as the number with n 3\\'s.\\n\\nSo N_n = 3*(10^{n} -1)/9. For example, 3 = 3*(10^1 -1)/9 = 3*9/9=3. 33 = 3*(10^2 -1)/9 = 3*99/9= 33, etc.\\n\\nSo, N_n squared is [3*(10^n -1)/9]^2 = 9*(10^n -1)^2 / 81 = (10^n -1)^2 / 9.\\n\\nSo, simplifying, (10^{2n} - 2*10^n +1)/9. Let\\'s see.\\n\\nLet me compute N_1 squared: (10^2 - 2*10 +1)/9 = (100 -20 +1)/9=81/9=9, which matches.\\n\\nN_2 squared: (10^4 - 2*10^2 +1)/9 = (10000 -200 +1)/9 = 9801/9 = 1089, which is right. Its digit sum is 1+0+8+9=18.\\n\\nN_3 squared: (10^6 - 2*10^3 +1)/9 = (1,000,000 - 2,000 +1)/9= 998,001/9 = 110,889. Which is 1+1+0+8+8+9 = 27.\\n\\nSimilarly N_4 squared would be (10^8 -2*10^4 +1)/9 = (100000000 -20000 +1)/9 = 99,980,001 /9 = 11,110, 000.1? Wait, no, let\\'s calculate:\\n\\nWait 100000000 minus 20000 is 99,980,000. Adding 1 gives 99,980,001. Divide by 9: 99,980,001 ÷9. Let\\'s see: 9*11,110,000 = 99,990,000. Hmm, so 99,980,001 minus 99,990,000 is negative. Wait my division is off.\\n\\nCompute:\\n\\n9*11,108,889 = 99,980,001. Let\\'s see:\\n\\n11,108,889 *9:\\n\\n10,000,000*9 =90,000,000\\n\\n1,108,889*9=9,979, 001?\\n\\nWait, 1,000,000*9=9,000,000\\n\\n108,889 *9=979, 001? Let me do 108,889 *9:\\n\\n(100,000*9)+(8,000*9)+(800*9)+(80*9)+(9*9)= 900,000 +72,000 +7,200 +720 +81.\\n\\nAdding up:\\n\\n900,000 +72,000 = 972,000\\n\\n+7,200 = 979,200\\n\\n+720 = 980, 920? Wait, 979,200 +720 = 979,920.\\n\\n+81= 979, 001? Hmm, so 1,088,889? Wait maybe miscalculations.\\n\\nAlternatively, let\\'s just accept that the formula is (10^{2n} - 2×10^n +1)/9.\\n\\nThus, for n=4, that would be (10^8 - 2×10^4 +1)/9 = (100,000,000 -20,000 +1)/9 = 99,980,001 /9.\\n\\n9 into 99 is 11, then 9 into 9 is 1, but after the comma: let\\'s do division step by step.\\n\\n99,980,001 ÷ 9:\\n\\n9 | 99,980,001\\n\\nDivide 9 into 9:1, 9 onto the next 9, etc.\\n\\nStarting from the left:\\n\\nFirst digit: 9 ÷9=1.\\n\\n ninth digit: next 9: 9 divided by9 is 1, so so far 1 1.\\n\\nNext digit 9, so next 9: another 1. Next digit, 8. Wait, maybe this is too time-consuming.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps we can note that the result is 11,110,  001?\\n\\nWait let me think of the square. Let\\'s compute 3333 squared manually maybe it\\'s faster.\\n\\n3333 × 3333.\\n\\nMultiplying 3333 × 3000 = 9,999,000\\n\\n3333 × 300 = 999,900\\n\\n3333 × 30 = 99,990\\n\\n3333 ×3 = 9,999\\n\\nAdding them up:\\n\\n9,999,000\\n\\n+999,900 → 10,998,900\\n\\n+99,990 → 11,098,890\\n\\n+9,999 → 11,108,889\\n\\nWait, so 3333 squared is 11,108,889. The digits: 1,1,1,0,8,8,8,9. So sum them:\\n\\n1+1+1+0+8+8+8+9.\\n\\nAdding 1+1=2, +1=3, +0=3, +8=11, +8=19, +8=27, +9=36. So 36? Hmm. So digit sum is 36. Which is 3²×4. So highest power of 3 is 9.\\n\\nEarlier n=1:9 (3²)\\n\\nn=2 (33^2):18 (2×3²)\\n\\nn=3 (333^2):27 (3³)\\n\\nWait wait, 27 is 3³, so 3³\\n\\nn=4, 3333 squared: digit sum 36 (which is 4×9)\\n\\nWait. Hmm, so there is a different pattern. Let me list:\\n\\nn | numbers | squared | digit sum | factors of 3\\n\\n1 | 3 | 9 |9 =3² | 2\\n\\n2 |33 |1089 |18 =2×3² |2\\n\\n3 |333| 110889|27=3³ |3\\n\\n4 |3333|11108889|36=4×9= 4×3² |2\\n\\nWait that doesn\\'t seem consistent. Wait this is strange. The digit sums for n=1 is 9, n=2 is 18, n=3 is 27, n=4 is 36, then perhaps the pattern is 9n. 9×1=9; for n=2, 18=9×2; for n=3, 27=9×3; n=4, 36=9×4. Wait, yes! That seems to be the case.\\n\\nWait 9×n. So digit sum is 9n. That is holding:\\n\\nFor n=1, 9×1=9\\n\\nFor n=2: 9×2=18 (matches)\\n\\nFor n=3: 9×3=27 (matches my calculation even though problem said 54? Wait but 9×3=27, so that would mean problem\\'s 333^2 digit sum is correct as 27. Then why do they say \"divisible by both 3 and 9\"? Well, yes 27 is divisible by 9 and 3. The problem only mentions both 3 and 9, but perhaps just emphasizing. The problem\\'s first is 9 (divisible by 3 and 9, but only mentioned 3). Maybe inconsistent wording.\\n\\nWait so according to this pattern, the digit sum S(n) of (number with n 3\\'s squared) is 9n.\\n\\nWait n=4: 9*4=36, which is indeed the digit sum of 3333 squared. So thus, this seems a valid generalization.\\n\\nThen, if the pattern continues, then for the given problem, which is 333,333 squared. Wait, how many 3\\'s is that? 333,333 has six 3s, right? 3-3-3-3-3-3: six digits. So n=6. Then the digit sum should be 9×6=54. Wait but according to the problem statement, for n=3 (333^2) it\\'s 54, but according to the previous example I had with n=3 it\\'s 27. So there\\'s a discrepancy here.\\n\\nWait, this is conflicting. Wait let\\'s re-examine the calculations again, perhaps I have miscalculated for n=3?\\n\\nWait earlier, for n=3: 333 squared was 110,889, which digits: 1 + 1 + 0 + 8 + 8 +9 = exactly 27. Therefore 9*n would be 27 when n=3, so 9*3=27, correct.\\n\\nWait then why would problem say \"the sum of the digits of 333 squared is 54\"?\\n\\nHmm, perhaps there\\'s a translation error or a typo in the problem statement. Maybe the third example refers to 3333^2 instead of 333^2?\\n\\nWait, the problem says: \"the sum of the digits of 3^2 is..., 33^2..., and 333^2...\", so n=1,2,3, so with n increasing, so if n=1 is 9, n=2 is 18, n=3 is 27, so it is 9n.\\n\\nTherefore, if the problem mentions that \"the sum for 333 squared is 27\", which is exactly 9×3, then everything is consistent. The problem says \"divisible by both 3 and 9\"—which is true for 27, so that\\'s okay.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the problem had an extra zero? Like 3333 squared instead? 3333 squared digit sum is 36. Hmm.\\n\\nSo if following the pattern S(n) = 9*n, then for 333,333, which is 6 threes (since 333,333 is six digits: 3,3,3,3,3,3), that would have digit sum 9*6=54. Then, the question becomes: What is the highest power of 3 dividing 54?\\n\\nSo 54 factors into 6*9=6*3²=2*3³. Therefore the highest power of 3 is 3³=27.\\n\\nWait but let\\'s check with n=6, is that actually the case? Let me compute 333,333 squared just to confirm.\\n\\nCalculating 333,333 squared:\\n\\nHmm, maybe it\\'s tedious but let me try.\\n\\nLet\\'s write N = 333,333.\\n\\nCompute N². Since N = 3,333,33, which is 3*(10^6 -1)/9 * 9? Wait, better to use the formula.\\n\\nN = 3*(10^6 -1)/9 ?\\n\\nWait let\\'s see, 10^6 -1 is 999,999, so 3/9*(10^6 -1) = (1/3)*(10^6 -1). Wait, no, wait:\\n\\nWait 3*(10^n -1)/9 = (10^n -1)/3. So for n=6, 10^6 -1 is 999999, divided by 3 is 333,333. So that\\'s correct.\\n\\nThus, N squared = ( (10^6 -1)/3 )² = (10^12 - 2*10^6 + 1)/9.\\n\\nDividing by 9, so (10^{12} -2*10^6 +1)/9.\\n\\nTo compute the digits of this number, note that 10^12 is 1 followed by twelve zeros.\\n\\nSo 10^12 - 2*10^6 +1 is:\\n\\n1 followed by 12 zeros:\\n\\n1000000000000\\n\\nMinus 2,000,000:\\n\\nIt would be 1000000000000 - 2000000 = 999,998,000,000\\n\\nThen adding 1: 999,998,000,000 + 1= 999,998,000,001\\n\\nThen dividing by 9:\\n\\nSo 999,998,000,001 /9 = ?\\n\\nLet me divide step by step:\\n\\nStart with 9 into 9:1\\n\\nThen second digit 9: 1\\n\\nContinuing, the first six digits:\\n\\n9 9 9, 998, etc.\\n\\nWait, 9 into 99,998,000,001:\\n\\nLet me divide:\\n\\nThe numerator is 999998000001.\\n\\nDivide 999998000001 by 9:\\n\\n9 divided by 9 =1, and we proceed.\\n\\nLet me see:\\n\\n9 | 9 9 9 9 9 8 0 0 0 0 0 1\\n\\nStarting from left:\\n\\nFirst digit 9: 1 with remainder 0.\\n\\nSecond digit:9, so next digit 1. 1 so far: 11.\\n\\nThird digit:9: another 1: 111.\\n\\nFourth digit:9: 1, so 111.\\n\\nFifth digit:9: 1: 111,1.\\n\\nWait wait, perhaps this will form a number with a repeating pattern?\\n\\nAlternatively, let me consider that N squared= (333333)^2. Let me compute it as follows:\\n\\n333,333 × 333,333.\\n\\nLet me break it into (300,000 + 33,333)^2.\\n\\nBut maybe even better to use the standard multiplication:\\n\\n333,333\\n\\n× 333,333\\n\\n----------------\\n\\nFirst multiply 333,333 ×3 = 1,000,  I mean 333,333 ×3 is 999,999\\n\\nWait let me do it step by step:\\n\\n333,333 × 300,000: 333,333 * 3*10^5 = 1,000, 000? Wait actual:\\n\\n333,333 × 100,000 = 33,333,300,000\\n\\n×3 → 100 million? Hmm, perhaps better to use the algorithm:\\n\\nThe multiplication will be:\\n\\n333333×333333.\\n\\nCompute 333,333 ×333,333:\\n\\nFirst, 333,333 × 3 = 999,999\\n\\nSecond, 333,333 × 30 = 9,999,990\\n\\nThird, 333,333 ×300 = 99,999,900\\n\\nFourth, 333,333 ×3,000= 999,999,000\\n\\nFifth, 333,333 ×30,000=9,999,990,000\\n\\nSixth, 333,333 × 300,000=99,999,900,000\\n\\nNow, sum all those terms:\\n\\nLet me write them out:\\n\\nLine 1: 999,999 (×3^0)\\n\\nLine 2: 9,999,990 (×10^1, so shifted right by 1)\\n\\nWait no, actually each subsequent term is shifted left by one more digit. Wait multiplication by a digit in each step.\\n\\nWait maybe it\\'s better to think of the standard long multiplication:\\n\\n        333333\\n\\n      × 333333\\n\\n      -----------\\n\\n        333333 ×3 = 999,999\\n\\n       333333 ×3 shift ×10 → 9,999,990\\n\\n      333333 ×3 shift ×100 →99,999,900\\n\\n     333333 ×3 shift ×1,000 →9,999,990,000 ×1 (wait, no, each digit is shifted left accordingly). Actually, each digit corresponds to a place, so each subsequent digit in 333,333 will shift multiplicatively.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe it\\'s too time consuming, and we can use the formula that was obtained earlier:\\n\\n(10^6 -1)^2 / 9 = (10^12 - 2*10^6 +1)/9.\\n\\nTherefore the number is 10^12 is 1 followed by 12 zeros.\\n\\nSubtract 2*10^6 (which is 2,000,000) gives 999,998,000,000.\\n\\nAdd 1: 999,998,000,001\\n\\nDivide by 9:\\n\\nLet me do this division step by step:\\n\\n9 divided into 999,998,000,001.\\n\\nStarting from the left:\\n\\n9 | 9 9 9 9 9 8 0 0 0 0 0 1\\n\\nFirst digit: 9/9=1.

Wait:\\n\\nWait after sixth digit:\\n\\nAfter fifth digit, quotient is 11111 (from first 5 digits). The sixth digit is 8. At this point:\\n\\nAfter the fifth digit process, we have a total of 1 (first digit) through 1 (fifth digit). The remainder after fifth digit is 0.\\n\\nThen processing sixth digit 8: 0 remainder +8 =8. 8 divided by 9 is 0. So quotient\\'s next digit is 0, remainder8.\\n\\nThen seventh digit 0: bring that down to form 80. 80 divided by9 is 8 (9*8=72), so quotient add 8, rem 8.\\n\\nEighth digit 0: bring down, making 8 (remainder) +0 overhang? Wait the remaining digit is 0, so total number is 80... wait actually, let me think in steps.\\n\\nLet me detail the process step by step:\\n\\n1. First digit: 9. 9 ÷9=1, Q=1, rem0.\\n\\n2. Second digit: 9. Bring down, total 09. 9 ÷9=1. Q=11, rem0.\\n\\n3. Third digit:9 → same, Q=111, rem0.\\n\\n4. Fourth digit:9 → Q=1111, rem0.\\n\\n5. Fifth digit:9 → Q=11111, rem0.\\n\\n6.

Q becomes 1111108, rem8.\\n\\n8. Eighth digit:0. Bring down to make 8*10 +0 =80. Again, 80 ÷9=8, rem8. Q→11111088, rem8.\\n\\n9. Ninth digit:0. Bring down:: 80. Divide by9→8. Q→111110888, rem8.\\n\\n10. Tenth digit:0. Same as above:→ divide again 80 →8, rem8. Q→1111108888, rem8.\\n\\n11. Eleventh digit:0. Bring down→ remainder8*10 +0=80→8, rem8. Q→11111088888.\\n\\n12. Twelfth digit:1. Bring down the last digit: previous remainder8 *10 +1 =81. 81 ÷9=9, rem0. Thus Q\\'s last digit:9, making the final Q:111110888889.\\n\\nSo the final quotient is 111,110,888,889.\\n\\nWait let me write that number: 111,110,888,889.\\n\\nBreaking down:\\n\\nThe digits are:\\n\\n1,1,1,1,1,0,8,8,8,8,8,9.\\n\\nWait let\\'s count:\\n\\n- First five 1s: 1,1,1,1,1,\\n\\n- then a 0,\\n\\n- followed by five 8s,\\n\\n- then a 9.\\n\\nWait fifth digit is 1, sixth is 0, then seventh to eleventh are 8s, and last digit 9.\\n\\nWait let me confirm the number 111110888889:\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo this is the result of 333,333 squared: 111,110,888,889.\\n\\nTherefore, to find the digit sum of this number:\\n\\nCompute digits:\\n\\nPosition: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\\n\\nDigit:    1 1 1 1 1 0 8 8 8 8 8 9\\n\\nTherefore, the digit sum is:\\n\\n1+1+1+1+1+0+8+8+8+8+8+9.\\n\\nLet me compute this:\\n\\nFirst five 1\\'s: 5*1=5,\\n\\nplus 0,\\n\\nplus five 8\\'s:5*8=40,\\n\\nplus 9.\\n\\nTotal:5 +0 +40 +9 =54. Correct! So the digit sum is indeed 54, which is 9×6, following the pattern.\\n\\nTherefore, back to the problem: the problem had a typo in the third example, saying 54 when n=3, but it\\'s actually 54 for n=6. Wait no, n=3 gives 27, which is 9×3. However, the problem says that for 333^2 it is 54, so that was a mistake in their problem, but since they said \"assuming this pattern continues\", we\\'ll follow the correct pattern (since it\\'s a math problem, we can\\'t rely on their perhaps incorrect example), so the pattern is digit sum is 9*n, where n is the number of 3s. So, the problem wants us to take the number 333,333, which has six 3\\'s (n=6), so the digit sum would be 54, correct.\\n\\nTherefore, the problem is ultimately asking: What is the largest power of 3 that divides 54?\\n\\nSo we have to factor 54 into prime factors. 54 = 6 ×9 = 6 × 3² = 2 × 3³.\\n\\nTherefore, the highest power of 3 dividing 54 is 3³ = 27.\\n\\nWait but let me confirm with another approach. The problem stated in its examples:\\n\\n- 3^2: digit sum 9 →3².\\n\\n- 33^2:18=2×3² (最高power of3 is 3²=9?)\\n\\n但问题说这个的sum is 27 divisible by 3 but not 9? 不，这有冲突。\\n\\nBut in their example for 33 squared they claimed digit sum is 27, but actual is 18. But regardless, proceeding with the problem\\'s instruction to assume the pattern continues as per their examples: Let me see what their stated pattern is.\\n\\nThey said:\\n\\n- 3^2 sum=9 (3^2)\\n\\n- 33^2 sum=27 (3^3)\\n\\n- 333^2 sum=54 ( possibly 2×3^3, because 54=2×3³)\\n\\n假设这个模式继续，所以:\\n\\n对于每多一个 three， exponent of 3在数字和中增长或者如何？\\n\\nFirst term: n=1 (three\\'s number count is1)\\n\\nsum is 9=3^2 → exponent is 2.\\n\\nSecond term: n=2: sum=27=3^3 → exponent is3.\\n\\nThird term: n=3: sum=54= 2×3^3 → the highest exponent dividing it is still3 (因为除了 3^3是27 divides 54). Wait 54 divided by 3^3 is 54/27=2, which is an integer, so yes. 但 their statement says for the third case it is divisible by both3 and9, which it is, divisible by27 too,其实。\\n\\n所以如果模式是n个3，平方后的数字和为3^{n+1}，但第三个例子中当n=3是54= 2×3^3，这不符合该模式。 但如果是n=1到3的案例：\\n\\n当n=1: 9=3^2,\\n\\nn=2:27=3³,\\n\\nn=3:54= 3³×2,\\n\\n可能模式是3^{n+1} 的两倍如果n是素数？ 或者 shortage在他们的例子\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the intended pattern is that the digit sum is 9, 27, 81,... multiplying by3 each time? 若是这样， the third term would be 81, not54. 所以 the problem\\'s examples might have a different pattern, but the calculations for the problem are correct when following the stated pattern.\\n\\nBut since in reality the correct digit sums give S(n)=9n, which gives:\\n\\nn=1:9=3² → maximum 3 exponent is2,\\n\\nn=2:18=2×3² → maximum is2,\\n\\nn=3:27=3³ →3,\\n\\nn=4:36=4×3² →2,\\n\\nn=5:45=5×3²→2,\\n\\nn=6:54=6×3³ →3³的因数数量， 54除以3三次方是54÷27=2, so最高幂 is3^3的。\\n\\n在问题中, 问题引用第三个例子作为the sum is 54, which is divisible by both3 and 9, 也就是说, it is saying that the sum is 54，即 the third case is n=3 gives 54. 所以 the problem\\'s stated example 的n=3 gives sum54。因此, perhaps the pattern given in the problem is S(n)=9×3^{n-1} ?\\n\\n因为:\\n\\nn=1:9×3^{0}=9,\\n\\nn=2:9×3^1=27,\\n\\nn=3:9×3²=81. 但问题中说 third example是， the sum是54, 所以这不符合这个模式. 所以 这可能不是正确的模式.\\n\\n 或者 perhaps the digit sums following their examples are:\\n\\nn=1:9 (3^2),\\n\\nn=2:27 (which is thrice of previous),\\n\\nn=3:54 (which is double of previous[\\'s 27]), 所以 没有 obvious pattern, 也许 the problem is having a mistake in its examples but assuming the pattern of S(n)=9*n, as per actual calculation, so that the question\\'s given case of six threes would be S(6)=54, factors of 3 是3³.\\n\\nTherefore, following the actual correct calculations, rather than their possibly incorrect problem examples, the answer would be3^3即 27.\\n\\nBut to be thorough, let me confirm the problem\\'s exact wording:\\n\\n“the sum of the digits of 3^2 is 9, which is divisible by 3; the sum of the digits of 33^2 is 27, which is divisible by 3 but not by 9; and the sum of the digits of 333^2 is 54, which is divisible by both 3 and 9. Assuming this pattern continues, what is the largest power of 3 that divides the sum of the digits of 333,333^2?”\\n\\n注意, 根据 they said for n=1 (3^2, sum9) divisible by 3 (which true but also9). For n=2 (33²,他们说 the sum is27 (若 it\\'s actually 18), which they claim 27 is divisible by3 but not by9, which would be impossible if it were truly 27. 但 18是 divisible by9.  Maybe they confuse their own examples.\\n\\n但 since we need to follow the problem\\'s stated pattern,即使 their examples are conflicting, 我们必须根据他们给出的模式.\\n\\n他們给出的模式是:\\n\\n1 个3 → sum是9 divisible by3 (but also9),\\n\\n2 个3 → sum27 divisible by3but not9? 但 27 is divisible by9,所以 maybe their claim is wrong in the second case.\\n\\nThrid例子:3个3 gives 54 which is divisible by3&9 (which it is, since54 is divisible by9 and3).\\n\\nSo the problem says that the pattern is:\\n\\nWhen you have n threes:\\n\\n- n=1:sum divisible by3,\\n\\n- n=2: sum divisible by3 but not by9,\\n\\n- n=3: divisible by3 and9,\\n\\nAnd asks us to continue the pattern.\\n\\nTherefore, maybe the actual patterns are:\\n\\n第 digit sums为:\\n\\n1 个3:9 → 3^2\\n\\n两个3的平方Digit sum27 → 3^3,\\n\\n3个3的平方的数字和是 54 → 2×3^3 = 2×27,\\n\\n upcoming terms:\\n\\n四是 3\\'s squared: 在 their pattern may diverge.\\n\\n But 根据 the problem\\'s given examples, we have to 追加 the pattern they described, not the actual计算. 因此可能 the sequence is: 9,27,54,… 以及 trying to find the next one in this pattern.\\n\\n Let me see the difference between terms:\\n\\n from9 to27 is ×3,\\n\\n27到54是×2,\\n\\n如果 the next term是×1.5或者 other, but this doesn\\'t follow a clear pattern.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe在 eighth case, the exponent increases by 1每 two terms or something.\\n\\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended that the digit sums are being multiplied by 3 each time, but the third term breaks it (9, 27, 81…). Since they say third term\\'s sum is54, this is inconsistent.\\n\\n Alternatively, the digit sum for n threes is 9×n的立方通 not.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps they just wanted us to use their stated values and notice the division conditions:\\n\\nFirst案例, sum9 → divisible by 3^2吗? 是的,最高是3^2.\\n\\nSecond case: sum27, which is divisible by3^3, so the highest power is 3^3.\\n\\nThird case: sum54 is divisible by3²×6 → the最高 power of3是3³因为54 /3^3= 2. 是的， 所以 highest power is3^3.\\n\\n因此, following their stated examples的模式, the sequence is the maximum power of3:\\n\\nn=1: 3^2,\\n\\nn=2:3^3,\\n\\nn=3:3^3与上.\\n\\n如果 the pattern continues这样的话, then接着,可能是 n=4 would have the same or higher?\\n\\nBut the problem asks for the next case with6 threes,即 n=6, but the stated examples only go up to n=3. 因此需要确定 pattern.\\n\\n按照他们的例子的说, with n=1到 3:\\n\\nn |最高 power of3\\n\\n1 | 3^2\\n\\n2 |3^3\\n\\n3 |3³ (54是div by3³)\\n\\n因此, perhaps the exponent of3 in the digit sum is 2+ n-1? 对于n≥1:当n=1，2=1+1?\\n\\n或者 2,3,3… maybe for n≥2, the exponent remains3?\\n\\n但Problem is asking关于6个3的平方的数字和.根据 their example\\'s pattern for n=3 (3 threes), the highest power3的 exponent is3.\\n\\n如果 the pattern is that the highest exponent is2当n=1,然后 increases to3 when n≥2, then remains there, so for n=6 it would still be 3^3?\\n\\nBut this seems arbitrary.Better to follow the correct digit sum:\\n\\n问题可能希望我们 follow the正确计算的模式, where the digit sum is 9×n. 因此，对于 n=6六个3s, the sum是54, which divides by3³ but not by3^4.\\n\\nTherefore the highest power is27.\\n\\n 这似乎 most logical.\\n\\n 因此， I think the answer is27.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\\\boxed{27}\\n</think>\\n\\nGiven the problem of finding the largest power of 3 that divides the sum of the digits of \\\\(333,333^2\\\\), we start by analyzing the provided examples and the results of squaring numbers composed of all 3s.\\n\\n1. **Example Analysis:**\\n   - \\\\(3^2 = 9\\\\). The sum of the digits is 9, which is \\\\(3^2\\\\).\\n   - \\\\(33^2 = 1089\\\\). The sum of the digits is \\\\(1 + 0 + 8 + 9 = 18\\\\), which is divisible by 9 and 3, but the problem states it is 27. However, correcting this, we see the actual sum is 18, divisible by both 3 and 9.\\n   - \\\\(333^2 = 110889\\\\). The sum of the digits is \\\\(1 + 1 + 0 + 8 + 8 + 9 = 27\\\\), which is divisible by 3 and 9.\\n\\n2. **Pattern Recognition:**\\n   - For a number with \\\\(n\\\\) threes, the digit sum of its square follows the pattern \\\\(9n\\\\). This is verified as follows:\\n     - \\\\(n=1\\\\) (3) gives \\\\(9 \\\\times 1 = 9\\\\).\\n     - \\\\(n=2\\\\) (33) gives \\\\(9 \\\\times 2 = 18\\\\).\\n     - \\\\(n=3\\\\) (333) gives \\\\(9 \\\\times 3 = 27\\\\).\\n\\n3. **Application to the Problem:**\\n   - The number \\\\(333,333\\\\) has 6 threes (\\\\(n=6\\\\)).\\n   - The digit sum of its square is \\\\(9 \\\\times 6 = 54\\\\).\\n\\n4. **Prime Factorization:**\\n   - The digit sum 54 factors as \\\\(54 = 2 \\\\times 3^3\\\\).\\n   - The largest power of 3 dividing 54 is \\\\(3^3 = 27\\\\).\\n\\nThus, the largest power of 3 that divides the sum of the digits of \\\\(333,333^2\\\\) is \\\\(\\\\boxed{27}\\\\).',\n",
